        <ul>
            <li>Playing the instruments</li>
            <p>- I love playing musical instruments, especially the acoustic guitar. It’s more than just a hobby for me—playing the guitar helps me relax and express myself through music. Playing instruments brings me a lot of joy.</p>

            <li>Playing Computer Games</li>
            <p>- In my free time, I like to play computer games such as Far Cry 5 and Valorant. These games offer a way for me to relax and have fun, while also challenging my mind. Games like Far Cry 5 allow me to explore exciting, open-world environments, while Valorant lets me improve my focus and teamwork skills. It’s a fun way to unwind while keeping my brain active.</p>

            <li>Creating Graphic Designs</li>
            <p>- Graphic design is something I’m really passionate about because it allows me to be creative and express my thoughts visually. It’s a great way for me to turn my ideas into something real that others can see and appreciate. I love experimenting with colors, shapes, and fonts to create designs that are both eye-catching and meaningful.</p>
